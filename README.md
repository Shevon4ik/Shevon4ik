### Hi there 👋


**Shevon4ik/Shevon4ik** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-🔭 I am now working on projects in 3D visualization and you can see my work here https://freelance.ru/shevon4ik

-🌱 I'm currently studying at KhAI and it's very cool

-👯 I want to cooperate with interesting people who suit me

-🤔 I need help with programming, for example, creating websites

-💬 Ask me about rendering interiors in 3D MAX and I will tell you

-📫 How to get to me: I live in Kharkov

-⚡ Interesting fact: I love to travel not only around the countries, but also in my native Luhansk region, and I have such a hobby as treasure hunting, this is very interesting, especially when there are interesting finds
